        <p>
          Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm and undergrad Computer Science student
          at Portland State University. Along with having an interest in CS
          topics like programming and algorithms, I'm also interested in working
          on old computers and electronics, playing video games, and I have an
          interest in History.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy building computers, and cleaning/fixing old computers and
          getting them working again. I'm also into mechanical keyboards, and
          because of that I've been learning how to solder. I like to play a
          variety of games, which include strategy games like Civilization VI,
          and RPG's like Fallout: New Vegas.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, I've taken 5 history classes while at PSU, covering topics
          like Medieval European History, the history of the American Indians in
          the Southeastern United States, and about the Renaissance and the
          Protestant Reformation. It's one of my favorite things to study, and I
          enjoy learning all kinds of things in history, like learning about
          pre-colonization societies, and learning about how people lived at
          different points in history.

          <br />
          One project I worked on was for the operating system called Xv6. It’s
          a OS thats mainly focused on teaching students about the in’s and
          out’s of of OS development, and how they function internally without
          giving them an OS thats too complex. For Xv6, I worked on creating new
          programs for the OS that could be run from it’s command line, worked
          on how processes were handled, implemented a round-robin scheduler,
          and implemented a multilevel feedback queue algorithm (MLFQ) into the
          scheduler. For the round-robin scheduler and MLFQ, the primary purpose
          of implementing those was to teach about how OSes avoid programs being
          unable to run due to other processes using up all of the resources,
          which was done by implementing states that the processes would run
          through to ensure that they would pause at some point and let others
          run, hence the name round robin. And the MLFQ algorithm adds to that
          by making it utilize multiple cores, and be able to prioritize what
          runs even better than a basic round-robin scheduler would. One of the
          ways it does this is by adding priority levels and a process promotion
          and demotion system to help determine what processes get to run and
          when.

          Another project I worked on was a group project for creating a program
          for a chocolate addicts anonymous help group. The program allowed for
          patient information to be entered and saved into a data structure on
          the backend, and then upon the program closing, would then write the
          data to a file. The program would also load the data back from the
          text file and set up the data structures to allow the user to edit the
          information already present. This project was done for a class
          teaching us about software engineering and to teach us how to work on
          software in a group setting. The main reason why we worked on this
          project was to familiarize ourselves with git and to get experience
          with working on a group programming project since we didn't have much
          prior experience with that, and to get experience with planning the
          development of our program and learning how to organize who does what
          in our project. We did the project in C++ since that's what most of us
          were familiar with.
