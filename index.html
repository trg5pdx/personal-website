              Blurp was a capstone project I worked on with 2 team leads, and a
              team of 10 people. It was a project for building an app that
              allows for users to map out their relationships to people, places,
              and ideas. This was meant as a tool for therapists to send to
              their patients before a session to help understand patients
              better. For this project, we went for a simplistic design, as the
              tools that already existed for this were specialized and
              inaccessible to most users, both being in terms of cost, and in
              terms of usability. I worked on the frontend portion of this app,
              which we used React, SigmaJS, and Graphology to make the app work.
              I worked on sending and retrieving data from the database, worked
              on different GUI components like the modal that appears upon
              loading in, and worked on getting the data associated with a node
              or relationship to be loaded into a form in the app that the user
              could edit and then save back to the node. Overall, the project
              was very interesting to work with, as it had me think about how
              users were going to be interacting with our software, and it had
              me learn a lot of new skills while working on it.

            <p>
              This was a chat client/server written in python meant to work in a
              similar way to an IRC chat client/server. However it isn’t
              compatible with the IRC protocol, as I wrote my own protocol for
              this client and server. This was written to get a chance to work
              with networking, and to be able to write software that uses te TDP
              protocol. The software I wrote for this allows for multiple users
              to connect and create chatrooms, send messages to one or more
              chatrooms, and be able to disconnect on their own. Users who
              joined a room after could join and receive the message history as
              they’re joining in. It was cool to work with networking, and to be
              able to send a message on one computer and see the result on
              another, and it was interesting working through the problems I ran
              into while programming this.
              <br />
              <br />
              For example, to get around the issue of only having one user
              connect at a time, I set up the server to be multithreaded, with
              one thread watching for new connections, and a new thread being
              created each time a user connects. Each user thread was set up to
              obtain the lock and add a message to the server when a new message
              was received, which it would then release the lock and the other
              threads would then see the change and send out the new message to
              the clients. I think this could’ve been done in a better way as
              its pretty inefficient to have two threads per client, but that
              was the way I approached it with the limited time I had.
              <br />
              <br />
              I also had issues with coming up how I would store the messages,
              and how I would set up the chatrooms, which I ultimately solved it
              by creating a map data structure for each chatroom, and wrote up a
              class for the chatrooms to help keep track of the data and the
              messages being stored. For actually parsing the packets, I went
              through multiple stages with how I designed it, eventually setting
              it up to use enums for each possible option of parsing, and to
              keep track of state as the parsers is going through each line of
              the received packet.

              One project I worked on was for the operating system called Xv6.
              It’s a OS thats mainly focused on teaching students about the in’s
              and out’s of of OS development, and how they function internally
              without giving them an OS thats too complex. For Xv6, I worked on
              creating new programs for the OS that could be run from it’s
              command line, worked on how processes were handled, implemented a
              round-robin scheduler, and implemented a multilevel feedback queue
              algorithm (MLFQ) into the scheduler. For the round-robin scheduler
              and MLFQ, the primary purpose of implementing those was to teach
              about how OSes avoid programs being unable to run due to other
              processes using up all of the resources, which was done by
              implementing states that the processes would run through to ensure
              that they would pause at some point and let others run, hence the
              name round robin. And the MLFQ algorithm adds to that by making it
              utilize multiple cores, and be able to prioritize what runs even
              better than a basic round-robin scheduler would. One of the ways
              it does this is by adding priority levels and a process promotion
              and demotion system to help determine what processes get to run
              and when.

              This was a simple key/value webserver that I wrote for a final
              project for my functional programming class. The server can only
              handle plaintext and html formatted data, and it only implements
              get and put http requests. It allows for users using software like
              netcat put data on the server, and allows for users to use a web
              browser to access that data and have it display properly in the
              browser. While not technically impressive, it was more meant as an
              exercise in abstracting different components of a webserver into
              small functions, and for me to write an application using a
              functional language.

              This website was a project for my web development class. It was
              meant to have us showcase what we learned during the course, which
              includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. We had to
              have a navbar, and have a section dedicated to talking about
              ourselves, a previous work section which would include work
              experience and possibly a resume, a section for projects we wanted
              to showcase, and a contact section. We also had to deploy the
              website using some hosting service like what github offers, and we
              had to keep a journal about the development process. For the
              contact section, we weren’t required to set up a system for
              sending the data entered by users, but we could if we wanted to.

              Another project I worked on was a group project for creating a
              program for a chocolate addicts anonymous help group. The program
              allowed for patient information to be entered and saved into a
              data structure on the backend, and then upon the program closing,
              would then write the data to a file. The program would also load
              the data back from the text file and set up the data structures to
              allow the user to edit the information already present. This
              project was done for a class teaching us about software
              engineering and to teach us how to work on software in a group
              setting. The main reason why we worked on this project was to
              familiarize ourselves with git and to get experience with working
              on a group programming project since we didn't have much prior
              experience with that, and to get experience with planning the
              development of our program and learning how to organize who does
              what in our project. We did the project in C++ since that's what
              most of us were familiar with.
