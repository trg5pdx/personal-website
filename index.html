            Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm and undergrad Computer Science student
            at Portland State University. I'm currently in my 5th year at PSU,
            and I'm close to finishing my degree. I have about a year left, with 
            most of the classes I have left being CS electives and the Capstone 
            courses I need before graduation. I finished most of my required 
            courses for CS, including a class on operating systems, databases, 
            and amdorithms. Along with having an interest in CS topics like 
            programming and amdorithms, I'm also interested in working on old 
            computers and electronics, playing video games, and studying history.

            I enjoy building computers, and I enjoy working on old computers,
            I find it very satisfying to clean up an old machine and to get it
            working again to run older software and games. I also go to thrift
            stores semi regularly to look for old electronics, games, and books
            to get more stuff to work on that relates to my hobbies. I'm also 
            into mechanical keyboards, and because of that I've been learning 
            how to solder. I like to play a variety of games, which include 
            strategy games like Civilization VI, and RPG's like Fallout: New Vegas.

            So far, I've taken 5 history classes while at PSU, covering topics
            like Medieval European History, the history of the American Indians
            in the Southeastern United States, and about the Renaissance and the
            Protestant Reformation. It's one of my favorite things to study, and
            I enjoy studying all kinds of topics in history, like learning about
            pre-colonization societies and how they were structured, and learning 
            about how people lived at different points in history.

              One project I worked on was for the operating system called Xv6.
              It’s a OS thats mainly focused on teaching students about the in’s
              and out’s of of OS development, and how they function internally
              without giving them an OS thats too complex. For Xv6, I worked on
              creating new programs for the OS that could be run from it’s command
              line, worked on how processes were handled, implemented a
              round-robin scheduler, and implemented a multilevel feedback queue
              algorithm (MLFQ) into the scheduler. For the round-robin scheduler
              and MLFQ, the primary purpose of implementing those was to teach
              about how OSes avoid programs being unable to run due to other
              processes using up all of the resources, which was done by
              implementing states that the processes would run through to ensure
              that they would pause at some point and let others run, hence the
              name round robin. And the MLFQ algorithm adds to that by making it
              utilize multiple cores, and be able to prioritize what runs even
              better than a basic round-robin scheduler would. One of the ways it
              does this is by adding priority levels and a process promotion and
              demotion system to help determine what processes get to run and
              when.

              This website was a project for my web development class. It was
              meant to have us showcase what we learned during the course, which
              includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. We had to
              have a navbar, and have a section dedicated to talking about
              ourselves, a previous work section which would include work
              experience and possibly a resume, a section for projects we wanted
              to showcase, and a contact section. We also had to deploy the
              website using some hosting service like what github offers, and we
              had to keep a journal about the development process. For the contact
              section, we weren’t required to set up a system for sending the data
              entered by users, but we could if we wanted to.

              Another project I worked on was a group project for creating a
              program for a chocolate addicts anonymous help group. The program
              allowed for patient information to be entered and saved into a data
              structure on the backend, and then upon the program closing, would
              then write the data to a file. The program would also load the data
              back from the text file and set up the data structures to allow the
              user to edit the information already present. This project was done
              for a class teaching us about software engineering and to teach us
              how to work on software in a group setting. The main reason why we
              worked on this project was to familiarize ourselves with git and to
              get experience with working on a group programming project since we
              didn't have much prior experience with that, and to get experience
              with planning the development of our program and learning how to
              organize who does what in our project. We did the project in C++
              since that's what most of us were familiar with.
