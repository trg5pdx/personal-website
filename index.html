            Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm and undergrad Computer Science student
            at Portland State University. I'm currently in my 5th year at PSU,
            and I'm close to finishing my degree. I have about a year left, and
            I finished most of my required courses for CS, including a class on
            operating systems, databases, and algorithms. Along with having an
            interest in CS topics like programming and algorithms, I'm also
            interested in working on old computers and electronics, playing
            video games, and I have an interest in History.

            I enjoy building computers, and cleaning/fixing old computers and
            getting them working again. I'm also into mechanical keyboards, and
            because of that I've been learning how to solder. I like to play a
            variety of games, which include strategy games like Civilization VI,
            and RPG's like Fallout: New Vegas.

            So far, I've taken 5 history classes while at PSU, covering topics
            like Medieval European History, the history of the American Indians
            in the Southeastern United States, and about the Renaissance and the
            Protestant Reformation. It's one of my favorite things to study, and
            I enjoy learning all kinds of things in history, like learning about
            pre-colonization societies, and learning about how people lived at
            different points in history.

            One project I worked on was for the operating system called Xv6.
            It’s a OS thats mainly focused on teaching students about the in’s
            and out’s of of OS development, and how they function internally
            without giving them an OS thats too complex. For Xv6, I worked on
            creating new programs for the OS that could be run from it’s command
            line, worked on how processes were handled, implemented a
            round-robin scheduler, and implemented a multilevel feedback queue
            algorithm (MLFQ) into the scheduler. For the round-robin scheduler
            and MLFQ, the primary purpose of implementing those was to teach
            about how OSes avoid programs being unable to run due to other
            processes using up all of the resources, which was done by
            implementing states that the processes would run through to ensure
            that they would pause at some point and let others run, hence the
            name round robin. And the MLFQ algorithm adds to that by making it
            utilize multiple cores, and be able to prioritize what runs even
            better than a basic round-robin scheduler would. One of the ways it
            does this is by adding priority levels and a process promotion and
            demotion system to help determine what processes get to run and
            when.

            This website was a project for my web development class. It was
            meant to have us showcase what we learned during the course, which
            includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. We had to
            have a navbar, and have a section dedicated to talking about
            ourselves, a previous work section which would include work
            experience and possibly a resume, a section for projects we wanted
            to showcase, and a contact section. We also had to deploy the
            website using some hosting service like what github offers, and we
            had to keep a journal about the development process. For the contact
            section, we weren’t required to set up a system for sending the data
            entered by users, but we could if we wanted to.

            Another project I worked on was a group project for creating a
            program for a chocolate addicts anonymous help group. The program
            allowed for patient information to be entered and saved into a data
            structure on the backend, and then upon the program closing, would
            then write the data to a file. The program would also load the data
            back from the text file and set up the data structures to allow the
            user to edit the information already present. This project was done
            for a class teaching us about software engineering and to teach us
            how to work on software in a group setting. The main reason why we
            worked on this project was to familiarize ourselves with git and to
            get experience with working on a group programming project since we
            didn't have much prior experience with that, and to get experience
            with planning the development of our program and learning how to
            organize who does what in our project. We did the project in C++
            since that's what most of us were familiar with.
