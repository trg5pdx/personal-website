      <p class="paragraph">
        Hi, my name is Thomas and I'm an undergrad student. At this point, I think I have a little over 
        a year before graduation. I had a programming class in high school that taught the basics of web development, 
        which had us work on HTML/CSS and in the last part of the class JavaScript. I also took front end web dev for 
        a few weeks back in the spring term before taking a break from school for mental health reasons. So I have some 
        familiarity with web development but not really enough to actually make a decent website, so it will be cool to 
        learn more about it.

        As for a fun fact about myself, aside from working on computers, I also enjoy studying history. I took a few 
        AP history classes back in high school and I've taken a few history classes at PSU. This term I'm taking a 
        history class on renaissance europe and the protestant reformation. I've been interested in history since 
        high school, and if I wasn't a CS student, I think I would've been a historian instead.

        <h4>Xv6</h4>

            <br />
            One project I worked on was for the operating system called Xv6. It’s a OS thats mainly focused on teaching students 
            about the in’s and out’s of of OS development, and how they function internally without giving them an OS thats too 
            complex. For Xv6, I worked on creating new programs for the OS that could be run from it’s command line, worked on 
            how processes were handled, implemented a round-robin scheduler, and implemented a multilevel feedback queue algorithm 
            (MLFQ) into the scheduler. For the round-robin scheduler and MLFQ, the primary purpose of implementing those was to teach 
            about how OSes avoid programs being unable to run due to other processes using up all of the resources, which was done by 
            implementing states that the processes would run through to ensure that they would pause at some point and let others run, 
            hence the name round robin. And the MLFQ algorithm adds to that by making it utilize multiple cores, and be able to prioritize 
            what runs even better than a basic round-robin scheduler would. One of the ways it does this is by adding priority levels and 
            a process promotion and demotion system to help determine what processes get to run and when.
