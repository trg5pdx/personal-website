# personal-website

This is a personal website written for the final project in CS410 - Intro to Web Development.
The website uses HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery. The website contains an about
section where I talk a bit about myself, a previous work section where I talk about my work
experience, what I worked on in school, and the skills that I have, a projects section where
I highlighted some of the projects I've worked on while at PSU, and a contact me section which
includes links to my Github and LinkedIn.

## Live Version of the Website

The live version of this website can be viewed [`here`](https://trg5pdx.github.io/personal-website)

## Running the website

First, you need to clone the repository to your local machine, which you can do by running
the following command in your terminal:
$ git clone https://github.com/trg5pdx/personal-website

After that you have a few options for viewing the website. You can open the file labelled
`index.html` in your web browser to run the code, or if you're using an editor like VS Code,
you can use an extension like Live Server to run it, which it will automatically open the page
in your web browser after starting the server.
